"""
This script reads the file that was created by getFreelancerUsers.py line-by-line.
Each line contains the url to the profile page of a freelancer. The script then downloads
the profile page for each url and stores it in a new file. The name of the new file should
be the same as the username of the corresponding freelancer.
