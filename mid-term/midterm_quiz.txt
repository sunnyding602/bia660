Step 1: Select 4 different websites that include reviews on TVs. The reviews should include text, a date of submission, and a star rating.
Step 2: Collect at least 1000 TV reviews from each of the 4 websites. Use a different python script for each website.
Step 3: Store all the reviews from all 4 websites in a single file called "reviews.txt". The file should include the following TAB-separated columns:
    •   column 1: website where the review came from (e.g. amazon.com).
    •   column 2: the FULL review text, exactly as it appears on the website.
    •   column 3: the review's rating 
    •   column 4: the review's date of submission, as it appears on the website.
This is a team assignment. Each team will have 20 minutes to present their work during next week's class (Oct 7).
Please add the four collection scripts and reviews.txt into a single zip file and submit it through moodle before next week's class.
